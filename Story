Once upon a time, there was a very happy prince. 
This prince would not cry for anything and does not get sad, he made his castle wall really tall.
The reason for it, was to never encounter bad things or the things that will make him sad.
He always wanted to smile and he could not stand crying.
His people would envy him, and wanted to be more like him.
One day prince died.
They immediately made his statue to honor him.
This statue was located in the highest spot in town and made out of gold.
